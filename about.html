    <h2>About ExploreX</h2>
    <p>We are a passionate travel agency helping adventurers explore the world since 2010. Our mission is to make travel accessible, enjoyable, and memorable.Back in 2010, ExploreX was born out of a very simple dream — to make travel more than just a checklist of destinations. It started with two friends who loved backpacking, getting lost in new cities, and finding beauty in unexpected places. They believed that travel is not only about reaching a location, but about the stories, people, and memories you create along the way.

In the early days, ExploreX was just a tiny desk with a laptop and a world map pinned to the wall. The team would spend hours listening to travelers, guiding them with personalized routes, and suggesting hidden gems that weren’t in glossy magazines. Slowly, word spread. People realized that ExploreX wasn’t just selling trips- it was helping them live experiences.</p>
